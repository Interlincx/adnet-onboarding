## Effective Engineering

Following these guidelines will help you write better code, collaborate effectively with your team, and deliver high-quality software.

### Make it work, Make it Right, Make it Fast

WIth this principle in mind, focus on making the system work first, then make it right by tweaking incremental changes, and finally make it fast by optimizing the system.

Use this principle when starting a new project or working a large set of features.

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

Avoid duplicating code. If you find yourself writing the same code in multiple places, consider creating a function to encapsulate the logic into a pure function.

Use this principle when you find yourself writing or spot same code in multiple places.

### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

Keep the code simple and easy to understand. Avoid over-engineering, premature optimization, and unnecessary complexity.

Use this principle when you find yourself adding unnecessary complexity to your code.

### YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)

Avoid adding features or writing code that is not necessary for the current requirements. Focus on the current requirements and avoid adding unnecessary complexity.

Use this principle when you find yourself adding features that are not necessary for the current requirements.
